# ZappAPI

SnailAPI is a tiny, lightweight Node.js HTTP server framework built on the net module. It's great as a live example to learn more about HTTP servers and how to create one using the basic net module provided by Node. It uses Express-like methods and can perform basic Express commands like .get() .post() and .use()


It also supports:

- Middleware usage
- JWT auth with cookies
- Static file serving
- A tiny DB for testing and small projects!
- JSON responses


Just run 
```
node test
````

on your device and use Postman to try it out!
